# LILER


A simple url shortener application that is created using the API of [RELINK URL SHORTENER](https://rel.ink/) (which already is a great application)

## WHY WAS LILER CREATED?

There are many url shorteners available online. This application was made to learn few development and branding concepts. This project will be part of series of small applications created using various front-end and back-end technologies along with system architecture & design concepts. And these applications will be used to practise and learn new test automation tools, libraries, and frameworks.
